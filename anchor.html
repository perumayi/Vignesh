        <h3 id="Lion">Lion</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
        It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
        The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.
        It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
        One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
        Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</p>
        
        <p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. 
        The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.
        The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard "spine" or "spur" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around 5+1⁄2 months of age. It is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.
        Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder.[51] Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. 
        Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[52][53]
        Skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.</p>

        <h3 id="Cheetah">Cheetah</h3>
        <p>A cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a medium large cat which lives in Africa. It is the fastest land animal and can run up to 112 kilometers per hour for a short time. Most cheetahs live in the savannas of Africa. There are a few in Asia. 
        Cheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening.</p>

        <p>The cheetah compared to other big cats is light and slimly built. Its long thin legs and long spotted tail are necessary for fast running.[2] Its lightly built, thin form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of other big cats. The head-and-body length ranges from 112–150 centimetres (44–59 in).
        The cheetah stands 70 to 90 cm at the shoulder, and weighs 21–72 kilograms (46–159 lb).The slightly curved claws are only weakly retractable (semi-retractable).This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the other big cats, which have fully retractable claws.</p>

        <p>The cheetah is the fastest of the land dwellers. The acceleration of a cheetah allows it to reach speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers per hour in three seconds (its maximum speed is 112 kilometers per hour). 
        The speed that a cheetah can develop from the start in 3 seconds cannot be achieved by any sports racing car.</p>

        <h3 id="Tiger">Tiger</h3>
        <p>Tiger is a wild animal that lives in forests. It is a carnivorous mammal that preys on organisms like deer.They are quick-paced and are very fast.
        The body of tigers is in the color of red or orange with dark black stripes on the surface.</p>

        <p>Tigers are animals that live in the wild. They are hungry animals that prey on smaller organisms. Their food usually consists of deer and boars. These animals grow up fast and attain maturity at around 3 or 4 years. They can live for up to 20 years in the wild.
        Males of the species are heavier than their female counterparts as they have different body functions.
        The young ones of tigers are known as cubs and require special care at the time of their birth. This is the reason why most of the cubs don’t survive in the wild.
        They are endangered species, and their number has been declining for the past decade. Efforts are being made to conserve these mammals, and it has seen some improvement in countries like Nepal, India, Russia, and China.
        These animals are ferocious yet sensitive, so they must remain in the wild without any human interference.</p>

        <h3 id="Deer">Deer</h3>
        <p>deer, (family Cervidae), any of 43 species of hoofed ruminants in the order Artiodactyla, notable for having two large and two small hooves on each foot and also for having antlers in the males of most species and in the females of one species.
        Deer are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and many species have been widely introduced beyond their original habitats as game animals. One species, the reindeer (also known as the caribou), has been domesticated. Some swamp and island species are endangered, but most continental species are flourishing under protection and good management.
        Deer, when granted some protection, readily exploit man-made disturbances caused by agriculture, forestry, and urbanization. White-tailed deer, normally a cherished North American game animal, have even become pests in suburbs and cities in the United States and Canada.</p>

        <p>The word deer has been applied at times to species that are not cervids, such as the musk deer (Moschus) and mouse deer (Tragulus). However, the former is now placed in a separate family (Moschidae), while mouse deer are actually primitive ruminants of the family Tragulidae.
        With these exclusions, Cervidae becomes the deer family, a consistent, natural grouping of species.</p>

        <h3 id="Eagle">Eagle</h3>
        <p>In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An eagle may resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons.
        A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live prey.</p>

        <p>eagle, any of many large, heavy-beaked, big-footed birds of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae (order Accipitriformes). In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo.
        An eagle may resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live prey. They are too ponderous for effective aerial pursuit but try to surprise and overwhelm their prey on the ground. Like owls, many decapitate their kills. Because of their strength, eagles have been a symbol of war and imperial power since Babylonian times.
        Their likeness is found on Greek and Roman ruins, coins, and medals.</p>

        <h3 id="Fox">Fox</h3>
        <p>fox, any of various members of the dog family (Canidae) resembling small to medium-sized bushy-tailed dogs with long fur, pointed ears, and a narrow snout. In a restricted sense, the name refers to the 10 or so species classified as “true” foxes (genus Vulpes), especially the red, or common, fox (V. vulpes), which lives in both the Old World and the New World.
        Several other foxes belong to genera other than Vulpes, including the North American gray fox, five species of South American fox, the Arctic fox (includes the blue fox),
        the bat-eared fox, and the crab-eating fox.</p>
